*intro* 

Let's Save Food! has succesfully outgrown its current Google
Sheets and whatsapp system. 

Missed pickups, double bookings, and time-consuming coordination
are slowing down what should be a more frictionless mission.


Our solution:

A simplicity-first digital platform designed to streamline operations, eliminate as much friction as possible, reduce both food and time waste, and lower the barrier of entry for volunteers and other parties.

*inner*

Imagine a platform where:

- A volunteer opens their phone, sees nearby pickups sorted by
urgency and distance, and claims one with a tap.

- Stores and individuals can submit surplus food alerts directly,
  triggering instant notifications to available volunteers.

- Distribution centers know exactly what's coming in, and will be able to track stock, expiration dates, and inventory.

- Efficient communication hosted only between relative peers.


*why does it work?*

For volunteers: No more digging through spreadsheets or chats.
Just a clean mobile friendly interface showing available pickups,
routes and instructions.

For dispatchers: Real-time oversight replaces guesswork, and less
manual labor required for them.

For stores and partners: A simple way to report surplus food,
ensuring faster pickups.

*what we have*

At this moment, we have an app for volunteers, with a backend
storing all types of pickups, users, food articles, providers and
more.

This can be expanded with interfaces for distribution and storage
points. We believe a formal system that only allows a minimal
amount of nuance and informality will cater better to laws and
food safety as well.

*technical*

The technical implementations should also be considered.

A "simple" system with efficient choices will allow it to scale,
while minimising operation costs. Which is a very important
factor for the benefit of the environment and people maintaining the system.

Given the project is
open-source and maintained by volunteers, you want to keep the
operational cost as low as possibe.


For example, choosing Go as API can mean supporting the whole of
Belgium with less machines than I have on my one hand. // hoeveel machines heb je op uw hand :o


*closing*

We believe replacing the current error-prone system with this dedicated
platform, Let's Save Food! can reduce administrative overhead,
minimize food waste through better coordination, and focus more
resources on its core mission.

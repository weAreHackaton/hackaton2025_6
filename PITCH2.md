*intro* 

Let's Save Food! has succesfully outgrown its current Google
Sheets and whatsapp system. 

Missed pickups, double bookings, and time-consuming coordination
are slowing down what should be a more frictionless mission.


Our solution:

A simplicity-first digital platform designed to streamline
operations, eliminate as much friction as possible, reduce food- and time-waste, and lower the
barrier of entry for volunteers and other parties.

*inner*

Imagine a platform where:

- a volunteer opens their phone, sees nearby pickups sorted by
urgency and distance, and claims one with a tap.

- Stores and individuals can submit surplus food alerts directly,
  triggering notifications to available volunteers.

- Distribution centers know exactly what's coming in, track
  inventory and expiration dates.


*why does it work?*

For volunteers: No more digging through spreadsheets or chats.
Just a clean mobile friendly interface showing available pickups.

For dispatchers: a visual oversight, simple interface to manage
pickups, and a way to grant stores access to the platform for 
managing their recurring pickups.

For stores and partners: A simple way to report surplus food,
ensuring faster and accurate pickups.

*what we have*

At this moment, we have an app for volunteers, with a backend
capable of storing most of the information: volunteers, pickups,
distribution centers, food-providers and inventory articles.

There is no website or app for dispatchers or stores yet, but they
can easily be added and hooked into the existing backend.

We developped a fairly simple system because we believe a formal system 
that only allows a minimal amount of nuance and informality will be easier
for users, and cater better to laws and food safety also.

*technical*

The technical implementations should also be considered, for the
benefit of the environment and people maintaining the system.

A "simple" system with efficient choices will allow it to scale,
while minimising operation costs, Which is a very important
factor. Given the project is
open-source and maintained by volunteers, you want to keep the
operational cost as low as possibe.


*closing*

We believe replacing the current error-prone system with a more mature 
version of this dedicated platform, Let's Save Food! can reduce administrative overhead,
minimize food waste through better coordination, and focus more
resources on its core mission.

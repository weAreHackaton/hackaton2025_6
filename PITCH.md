## Problem

Let's Save Food has outgrown their current organisational system.
The spreadsheet system can be fine for some period, but currently
is has become error-prone, clunky and inefficient.

**How can we tackle this issue? (solution)**

We suggest a simple, frictionless, scalable platform.

This system would fullfill the following criteria:
- It is easy for new and recurring volunteers to interact and
deliver food 

- A low barrier for entry, for every party involved. For entities
  to join the cause, you want to make it as easy as possible for
  them.


It should be a breeze for every end user to use and interact with
the platorm.

How do we achieve this?

- Formalise most of the structures and communications. This makes
  it clear for everyone what is needed, and how to do it. No more
  human coordination is needed for pickups. Volunteers can
volunteer for a pickup, and it is registered in the system.

By formalisation, we reduce alot of the currently needed
communication and organisation. This saves manpower and is more
user friendly.

The provider is notified of this, and both are able to contact
eachother.


How do we define simple?

The removal of unneeded communications and overhead.


## Plot


- infrastructure and operational cost.
Since the platform and infrastructure would (eventually) and
(mostly) be made up of volunteers, it is important to keep the
whole stack and system simple aswell. Another important factor
may be operational cost. With the right choice of language, such
as Go, you could provide the whole of Belgium with very, very
little infrastructure.
